In 1.4.0 StealTools added a new **optimize** API which aims to replace [stealTools.build](steal-tools.build)
as the default way of creating a build of a module and all of its dependencies; builds created by `stealTools.optimize` are smaller and load faster.

Unlike regular [builds](steal-tools.build), optimized builds don't need to load or bundle StealJS at all; a thin wrapper is added instead to the main bundle so the browser can load and execute the modules correctly. 

> The **optimize** API is a work in progress, some StealJS features are not supported yet.

In this guide, we'll go through the steps required to create and use an optimized build. We'll be using the
`myhub` application created in the [Progressive Loading](./StealJS.guides.progressive_loading) guide.


## Install Prerequisites

### Window Setup

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Chocolatey, Python, Windows SDK, and Visual Studio as described [here](http://stealjs.com/docs/guides.ContributingWindows.html).

### Linux / Mac Setup

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).

## Setting up myhub

### Clone the Github repo 

Run the following command:

```
> git clone git@github.com:stealjs/myhub.git
```

### Install dependencies

As mentioned before, the **optimize** API is still in its early days, for that reason 
we need to use some pre-release packages.

Edit your `package.json` like:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  ...
  "steal-css": "^1.3.0-pre.0",
  "steal-tools": "^1.4.0"
}
```

Run `npm install` to install all the application dependencies.

### Make an optimize build script

Currently, there is no CLI option to use the `stealTools.optimize` function, so a NodeJS script is required.

Create _optimize.js_:

```js
var stealTools = require("steal-tools");

// use the defaults
stealTools.optimize();
```

Run the build script with:

```
> node optimize.js
```

Now, start an http server by running `npm start` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`
in a web browser. You should see myhub's home page.

> One limitation of the optimized loader is that unlike StealJS' loader it does not normalize module identifiers on runtime. For static imports that's not a problem, but it's an issue for dynamic imports (through steal.import), the module identifier needs to match the name set in [config.bundle].

### Performance comparison

For most application builds where StealJS is not included in each of the main bundles, optimized builds will
have one fewer http request on the initial load which is already a win.

In this example, we are comparing how fast the load event is fired (this event is fired when a resource and its dependent resources have finished loading) when creating the build using `stealTools.build` (with `bundleSteal` set to `true`) and `stealTools.optimize`.

In the screenshot above, the build created by [stealTools.build](steal-tools.build) takes 157ms to 
fire the load event, in contrast the optimized build takes 119ms (24% faster) to fire the load event, see the screenshot below.

It's also worth noting that the optimized bundles are smaller; the gzip size of the optimized main bundle is 31.8 kB compared to the 59.5 kB bundle of the regular build (46% smaller!).

### Progressive loading and async script tags

So far we have only loaded the main module of the `myhub` application; one of the features of this application is that it progressively loads the modules needed to render the `weather` page and the `puppies` page only when the user navigates to any of these pages.

![weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/724877/27666155-16d23f86-5c2f-11e7-997f-c117416b8196.png)

Once again, the optimized bundle is smaller than the regular one (although the difference is less that 1 kB); but unlike regular bundles loaded with StealJS, the optimized loader can handle bundles loaded using script tags; which means we can take advantage of the browser capability to download the bundle and parse its code without blocking the main thread and without waiting for the user to click any of the navigation links.

Edit `index.html` to asynchronously load the bundles of the other two pages like this:

```html
<body>
  <div class="container">Hello World.</div>
  <script async src="./dist/bundles/myhub/myhub.js"></script>
  <script async src="./dist/bundles/myhub/weather/weather.js"></script>
  <script async src="./dist/bundles/myhub/puppies/puppies.js"></script>
</body>
```

If you reload your browser, you'd notice that there are two extra requests and the load event takes more or less the same time to fire as before. The browser downloaded and parsed the bundles without blocking the main thread, instead of waiting for the user to navigate away from the home page, which results in smoother transitions.

Navigate to the puppies page and see it for yourself!
